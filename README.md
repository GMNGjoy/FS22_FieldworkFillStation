# Fieldwork Fill Station
My first ever mod for Farming Simulator 22 that was submitted to ModHub &amp; accepted on Aug 30, 2022, now with over 120k downloads!

The Fieldwork Fill Station is designed to provide your farm with all of it's Fieldwork Fill needs - seeds, fertilizer, lime, slurry, manure, digestate, water, and even silage additive. With a fill speed of 4000 l/m, it's the fastest water source on console! 

In the _1.1.0.0_ update, we're introducing a _Silo_ version that you can fill on your own (or buy from the direct), as well as an _Old_ style of the Fill Station (in all three versions) that is all rusty for those start from nothing thematic playthroughs. Unfortunately, the _Silo_ version does not support the 30% discount.

The Fieldwork Fill Station is released for _ALL PLATFORMS_.
